# Shrug MVP Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the MVP implementation plan for Shrug, based on an accurate assessment of what actually exists and works in the codebase. The plan focuses on the essential missing pieces needed for a viable product.

## Core Vision

**Shrug is a Q&A platform built on:**
- **Real user verification** - Users stand behind their content
- **Totem system** - Multiple perspective buckets prevent echo chambers
- **Customizable profiles** - Myspace-style content organization
- **Hybrid monetization** - Platform subscriptions + individual content sales + custom ads
- **Structured learning** - Curriculums as a key differentiator

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED & WORKING:**

#### **Core Platform (Complete)**
- **Totem System** - Full implementation with crispness, likes, user creation
- **User Authentication** - Firebase auth, email verification, profiles
- **Content Creation** - Questions, answers with totems, editing
- **Content Discovery** - Basic feed (latest, popular, for you), totem browsing
- **User Relationships** - Follow/unfollow system with UI integration

### ⚠️ **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED (Code exists but UI is rough):**

#### **Profile Customization** - **PARTIALLY WORKING**
- **What Works:** Basic profile editing (name, username, bio)
- **What's Rough:** 
  - Profile sections exist in code but UI is incomplete
  - Section management exists but is clunky
  - Avatar upload UI exists but no actual upload functionality
  - Profile organization features are there but not user-friendly

#### **Subscription System** - **MOCK IMPLEMENTATION**
- **What Exists:** UI for subscription management
- **What's Missing:** 
  - No real payment processing (just mock data)
  - No Stripe integration
  - Subscription changes just update local state
  - No actual billing or payment flows

#### **Content Gating** - **MOCK IMPLEMENTATION**
- **What Exists:** UI controls for gating content
- **What's Missing:**
  - No real payment processing for gated content
  - Mock data only, no real database integration
  - No actual access control enforcement
  - No purchase tracking

### ❌ **MISSING FOR MVP (12-15 days total):**

## Technical Approach

### **Search Implementation**
```typescript
// Create search components
- SearchBar component (header/navigation)
- SearchResults page
- Search suggestions/autocomplete
- Connect to existing PostService.searchPosts()
```

### **Payment Integration**
```typescript
// Stripe integration
- Create checkout sessions
- Handle webhooks
- Update subscription status
- Process gated content purchases
- Replace mock subscription system
```

### **Profile Polish**
```typescript
// Profile improvements

- Make customization more intuitive
```

### **Custom Ad System**
```typescript
// Ad creation and tracking

- Conversion tracking
- Payout calculation
```

## Success Metrics

### **MVP Launch Criteria:**

- [ ] Users can upgrade to premium (real payments)
- [ ] Creators can gate content (real payments)
- [ ] Users can purchase gated content
- [ ] Profile customization works smoothly
- [ ] Custom ads can be created and tracked

### **Post-MVP Enhancements:**
- Curriculum system
- Advanced verification
- Enhanced mobile experience
- Analytics dashboard
- Creator earnings dashboard

## Risk Assessment

### **Low Risk:**
- Search functionality (backend exists)
- Profile polish (structure exists)

### **Medium Risk:**
- Payment integration (needs Stripe setup)
- Custom ad system (new feature, needs testing)

### **High Risk:**
- Advanced verification (third-party dependencies)

## Timeline Summary

**Total MVP Development: 11-14 days**
- **Week 1:** Search + Payments (6-8 days)
- **Week 2:** Profile Polish + Custom Ads (5-6 days)
- **Week 3:** Advanced Verification (2-3 days)

## Key Insights

### **What I Learned from Investigation:**
1. **Profile sections exist** but the UI is rough and not user-friendly
2. **Subscription system is mock** - no real payments, just UI
3. **Content gating is mock** - no real access control or payments
4. **Avatar upload UI exists** but no actual upload functionality
5. **Many features marked "complete"** are actually just code that exists but doesn't work properly

### **Realistic Assessment:**
- **Core platform is solid** (totems, auth, content creation)
- **Monetization framework exists** but needs real payment integration
- **Profile customization exists** but needs UI polish
- **Search is missing entirely** (backend exists, no UI)

This plan focuses on making the existing features actually work and adding the critical missing pieces for a viable MVP.
