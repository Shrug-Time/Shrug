# Shrug MVP Implementation Plan

2. **✅ DONE:** Search functionality (unified search across posts, users, totems)
3. **✅ DONE:** Community ad system (subscription promotion with PDF/PNG uploads)
4. **💰 CRITICAL:** Payment system (subscriptions and content gating need real money)
5. **👤 POLISH:** Profile customization (avatar upload, better section management)
6. **📚 NEW:** Curriculum system (structured learning paths for creators)
