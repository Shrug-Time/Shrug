# Premium Content Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the Premium Content Access feature for Shrug, following the requirements in the Implementation Plan.

## Overview

The Premium Content Access implementation includes two distinct monetization approaches:

1. **Platform Subscription Tiers** - Free vs. Premium membership tiers with different feature sets
2. **Creator Content Gating** - Individual content gating for creators to monetize their expertise

## Architecture

The implementation follows a layered architecture:

### 1. Service Layer

- **SubscriptionService**: Manages platform-level subscription tiers
  - Handles membership tier verification
  - Manages refresh limits based on tier (5 for free, 20 for premium)
  - Tracks subscription changes

- **ContentGatingService**: Handles creator-controlled content gating
  - Manages content access control
  - Tracks purchases and access rights
  - Provides content gating status

### 2. Context Layer

- **SubscriptionContext**: Provides subscription state throughout the app
  - Checks premium status
  - Tracks refreshes remaining
  - Manages tier updates

- **ContentGatingContext**: Provides gating functionality across the app
  - Checks creator eligibility
  - Manages content gating status
  - Tracks gated content and purchases

### 3. UI Components

- **SubscriptionManagement**: User interface for managing subscription tiers
- **ContentGatingControls**: Creator controls for gating content
- **ProfileSidebar**: Navigation for accessing premium features

## Progressive Verification Approach

To balance growth with content quality, we've implemented a progressive verification system:

### 1. Launch Phase (Current Implementation)
- **Email Verification**: Only requires basic email verification
- **Simple UI**: Clear messaging about verification status
- **Low Barrier**: Allows maximum participation during early growth

### 2. Growth Phase (Ready to Implement)
- **Follower Requirements**: Code structure supports adding minimum follower counts
- **Manual Verification**: Admin-approved creator status
- **Profile Completion**: Encouraging but not requiring social media linking

### 3. Maturity Phase (Framework in Place)
- **Multi-Factor Verification**: Social media, phone, and ID verification
- **Trust Scoring**: Algorithmic determination of creator eligibility
- **Reputation System**: Community input on creator credibility

The implementation is designed with flexible eligibility criteria that can evolve without changing the UI components or overall architecture.

## User Interface

The premium content features are integrated into the user profile section:

1. **Profile Sidebar**: Contains links to:
   - Content (includes gating controls)
   - Subscriptions (manage membership tier)
   - Subscribers (view users who can access premium content)

2. **Content Management**: Allows creators to:
   - View all content
   - Filter to only premium content
   - Toggle gating status for individual content items
   - Set default access level

3. **Subscription Management**: Allows users to:
   - View current subscription status
   - See remaining refreshes
   - Switch between free and premium tiers

## Integration Points

### 1. Ad Display

The `AdBanner` component only renders for free users, checking the subscription status to conditionally show/hide ads.

### 2. Access Control

Content access is controlled through the `ContentGatingService.userHasAccess()` method, which checks:
- If the content is gated
- If the user is the content creator
- If the user has purchased access

### 3. Refresh Limits

Refresh limits are enforced through the `SubscriptionService.getRemainingRefreshes()` method, which:
- Checks the user's membership tier
- Returns the appropriate limit (5 for free, 20 for premium)
- Handles daily refresh resets

## Extending the Implementation

### Adding Payment Processing

To integrate real payment processing:

1. Extend `SubscriptionService` with:
   ```typescript
   static async createCheckoutSession(userId: string, tier: MembershipTier): Promise<string> {
     // Integrate with Stripe or other payment provider
     // Return checkout session ID
   }

   static async handleSubscriptionWebhook(event: any): Promise<void> {
     // Process webhook events from payment provider
     // Update user's membership tier
   }
   ```

2. Create API routes for checkout and webhooks in `/api/subscriptions/`

### Database Integration

1. Create Firestore collections:
   - `subscriptions` - Track user subscriptions
   - `gatedContent` - Store content gating settings
   - `contentPurchases` - Record purchases of gated content

2. Update security rules to enforce access control:
   ```
   match /gatedContent/{contentId} {
     allow read: if isAuthenticated();
     allow write: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.creatorId;
   }
   ```

## Testing

The current implementation includes mock data for development. To test:

1. Navigate to `/profile/content` to see content gating controls
2. Visit `/profile/subscriptions` to manage subscription tiers
3. Toggle between free and premium to see the ad banner appear/disappear

## Future Enhancements

1. **Analytics Dashboard**: Track subscription metrics and content performance
2. **Tiered Pricing**: Allow creators to set different price points
3. **Subscription Bundling**: Enable users to subscribe to specific creators
4. **Trial Periods**: Implement free trials for premium membership
