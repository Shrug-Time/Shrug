# Project Plans and Progress

## Master Plan

### 1. Debugging & Stability
- [ ] Fix current like/unlike functionality issues
- [ ] Debug and fix any UI state inconsistencies
- [ ] Add comprehensive error logging
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
- [ ] Add user feedback for failed operations

### 2. Testing Implementation
- [ ] Set up comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Add unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Implement integration tests
- [ ] Add end-to-end testing

### 3. Code Quality
- [ ] Remove legacy field support
- [ ] Standardize error handling
- [ ] Improve type safety
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging

### 4. Data Structure Optimization
- [ ] Implement denormalized user activity collections
  - Create `userActivities/{userId}/posts/{postId}`
  - Create `userActivities/{userId}/answers/{answerId}`
  - Create `userActivities/{userId}/totems/{totemId}`
- [ ] Update service methods to maintain both data structures
- [ ] Implement efficient pagination for profile pages
- [ ] Set up monitoring for database performance

### 5. Performance Improvements
- [ ] Optimize database reads and writes
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- [ ] Add skeleton loaders for pagination
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring and alerts

### 6. User Experience
- [ ] Implement optimistic UI updates
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Improve error messages
- [ ] Enhance mobile responsiveness

## Completed Work

- ✅ Identified and fixed root cause of like/unlike issues
- ✅ Implemented proper one-like-per-user validation
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- ✅ Created cleanup script for data consistency

### Standardization (v1.5)
- ✅ Standardized field names and data models
- ✅ Created utility functions for consistent field access
- ✅ Updated service layer with standardized fields
- ✅ Implemented backward compatibility

## Decision Log

### Recent Decisions
[2025-03-21] Decided to implement denormalized data structure for user activities
REASON: To improve query performance, reduce index errors, and better scale with increasing user activity

[2025-03-20] Successfully implemented and fixed totem functionality tests
REASON: To verify the enhanced like/unlike system with history tracking and crispness calculation

[2025-03-19] Started development of test suite for totem functionality
REASON: To verify the enhanced like/unlike system with history tracking and ensure crispness calculation works correctly

### Historical Decisions
[Previous decisions have been archived in CHANGELOG.md]

## Issue Tracker

### Active Issues
- [ ] Firestore index errors on profile page
  - ISSUE: Compound queries with array-contains and orderBy require custom indexes
  - SOLUTION: Implement denormalized data structure with direct subcollection queries

### Resolved Issues
- [x] Firebase config extraction issue
  - SOLUTION: Created more robust regex-based field extraction instead of JSON parsing
