# Firebase Standardization Plan

As part of Phase 1 (Data Structure Refinement) in the implementation plan, these steps should be completed to standardize Firebase usage throughout the application.

## Current State

The application currently has multiple Firebase initialization files:
- `/src/firebase.ts` - Main file with hardcoded config and comprehensive functionality
- `/src/lib/firebase.ts` - Uses environment variables but has basic functionality
- `/src/lib/firebaseAdmin.ts` - Server-side admin SDK with proper typing

## Standardization Steps

### 1. Firebase Client SDK Consolidation (Priority: High)

- [ ] Modify `/src/firebase.ts` to use environment variables instead of hardcoded config
- [ ] Ensure all helper methods are properly typed
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation for each exported function
- [ ] Update imports across the codebase to use this single source of truth
- [ ] Remove redundant `/src/lib/firebase.ts` after migration is complete

### 2. Firebase Admin SDK Refinement (Priority: Medium)

- [ ] Keep `/src/lib/firebaseAdmin.ts` for server-side operations
- [ ] Ensure it's only used in API routes and server components
- [ ] Add proper error handling for production environment
- [ ] Create standardized helper functions for common admin operations

### 3. Environment Variables Management (Priority: High)

- [ ] Document all required environment variables
- [ ] Add validation to ensure all required variables are present
- [ ] Provide development fallbacks with clear warnings
- [ ] Create an example `.env.example` file for new developers

### 4. Testing (Priority: Medium)

- [ ] Add tests for Firebase service functionality
- [ ] Create mocks for Firebase services in test environment
- [ ] Ensure tests run without requiring actual Firebase credentials

## Implementation Timeline

These standardization steps should be completed during Phase 1 of the implementation plan, before proceeding to Phase 2 (Core Functionality Improvement).

## Benefits

- Single source of truth for Firebase configuration
- Improved security through environment variables
- Clear separation between client and server-side Firebase usage
- Better developer experience with proper typing and documentation
