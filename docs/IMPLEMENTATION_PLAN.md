# Shrug Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for completing the Shrug platform MVP. The plan is structured in phases, with each phase building on the previous one. Each section includes:

- **What We're Doing**: Non-technical explanation of the goal
- **Why It Matters**: The benefit to users and the platform
- **Technical Approach**: How we'll implement it
- **Timeline Estimate**: Approximate implementation time

## Phase 1: Data Structure Refinement (1-2 weeks)

### What We're Doing
We're organizing how information is stored in the database to make it more efficient - like organizing a filing cabinet so you can find things quickly.

### Why It Matters
- The app will load faster
- We can add new features more easily
- Information will be more consistent

### Technical Approach

#### REVISED APPROACH: Fresh Start (No Legacy Data Migration)
After careful review of the existing data structure and minimal active user data, we've decided to take a fresh-start approach rather than migrating legacy data. This will provide a cleaner foundation and faster implementation timeline.

1. **Define Standard Schema** (1-2 days)
   - Standardize on `firebaseUid` for all user references
   - Use numeric timestamps (milliseconds since epoch) consistently
   - Document all fields in TypeScript interfaces
   - Create strict validation for data consistency
   - Address multiple sources of truth identified in crispness calculation

2. **Reset & Rebuild Data Collections** (2-3 days)
   - Clear existing collections or create new ones with proper structure
   - Implement data access layer using standardized fields
   - Create separate collections for users, posts, answers
   - Add strategic denormalization where needed for performance
   - Ensure consistent active/inactive like handling

3. **Set Up Database Indexes** (1-2 days)
   - Create index configuration file
   - Add indexes for common search patterns
   - Implement proper pagination for all list views

4. **Route and Component Standardization** (2-3 days)
   - Standardize all URL patterns (e.g., use plural `/answers/` consistently)
   - Implement proper redirects for backward compatibility
   - Update components to handle data consistently
   - Fix duplicate content display issues in answer listings
   - Ensure consistent behavior for answer display and linking
   - Standardize error handling for missing content
   - Create unified approach for all list/detail views

**Total Revised Timeline**: 6-10 days (including route standardization)

**Key Benefits of Fresh Start Approach**:
- Eliminates technical debt from the beginning
- Avoids complex migration scripts
- Provides cleaner foundation for later phases
- Allows implementation of best practices without legacy constraints

### Confirmation Points
- Are there any specific data elements we should preserve from the existing system?
- Should we implement any data import tools for specific legacy content?
- What performance metrics should we target for data operations?

## Next Steps and Communication Plan

To address the concern about miscommunication and ensure you're fully informed at each step:

1. **Phase-by-Phase Approach**
   - Before starting each phase, we'll review the detailed plan for that phase
   - We'll break down each task into smaller steps with clear explanations
   - You'll have the opportunity to adjust priorities or requirements

2. **Regular Check-ins**
   - Brief updates at key milestones
   - Demonstrations of completed features
   - Discussion of any challenges or decisions needed

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Each completed phase will include documentation updates
   - Technical decisions will be recorded with explanations
   - Implementation details will be documented for future reference

4. **Decision Record**
   - All significant decisions will be documented
   - Alternative approaches considered will be noted
   - Reasoning behind choices will be explained in non-technical terms

Would you prefer we start with more detailed breakdowns of each phase now, or would you rather proceed phase by phase, diving deeper into each one as we reach it? 


Kyle's Thoughts:
Can we apply ads even if we decide not to use them?
How would recommendation system work?
Use think to consider how to create subcollections and better organize data
    In addition, use think to come up with the brst way to do the questions.
        i.e. How do you handle the million variations to one question?
