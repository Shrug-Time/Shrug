## Appendix: Hosting and Technical Debt

### Firebase Hosting Setup (Started but Deferred)

We began setting up Firebase hosting but encountered obstacles that reinforced the need for our implementation plan:

1. **Current Status of Hosting Setup**:
   - Firebase CLI tools installed
   - GitHub repository connected (Shrug-Time/Shrug)
   - CI/CD pipeline configured for main branch
   - Deployment attempted but blocked by code quality issues

2. **Encountered ESLint Errors**:
   - Production build failed due to numerous ESLint warnings and errors
   - Issues include: missing TypeScript types, inconsistent patterns, unused variables
   - These errors prevent production builds but don't affect development mode

3. **Decision to Defer Hosting Completion**:
   - Rather than applying temporary fixes, we're prioritizing the implementation plan
   - The issues encountered align exactly with what our plan already aims to address
   - Fixing errors outside the plan would create duplicate work and potential inconsistencies

4. **To Complete Hosting Later**:
   - After completing Phase 1 (Data Structure Refinement)
   - Run `npm run build` to verify errors are resolved
   - Run `firebase deploy` to complete deployment
   - Verify the site at the Firebase-provided URL

This experience validates our implementation approach - focusing on standardization and code quality first will create a stronger foundation before introducing new features.
